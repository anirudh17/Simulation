Simulation of Newtonâ€™s second law of motion       


    1. To find the acceleration of the object
    2. To find the change in velocity per second
    3. To find the displacement of objet over time per second 


Prerequisites:

     the code require python2.7,
     install python matplotlib library, To install it in linux the command given  
     below in Installing section
 

Installing:
      
      open terminal and write following command

      sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib


How To Run:
     
      1. open terminal
      2. Pursue the path in terminal(ex. cd /home/anirudh/../.. ) where
         newton_law.py file is save
      3. Run the program by writing below line
         python newton_law.py

Input:
      After the execution start it ask for input. Type of input is integer or 
      float

      1. force we want to apply on the object (unit is Newton)
      2. The mass of object on which we are applying force(Unite is Kg)
      3. The reverse force generate due to friction with surface.unite of
         measurement is Newton
         (friction less surface have zero reverse force)
      4. how much distance will object have to cover in meter
      
Output:
      1. output.txt file will generate after the execution of program.
         output.txt contain Time,Velocity,Distance table. Table shows
         how distance and velocity increase per second
      2. the live scatter plot will generate and it shows the change in velocity 
          and distance cover per second
      3. the program print live calculated data on terminal
